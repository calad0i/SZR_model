  author   = {Gillespie, Daniel T and Hellander, Andreas and Petzold, Linda R},
  abstract = {We outline our perspective on stochastic chemical kinetics,
              paying particular attention to numerical simulation algorithms.
              We first focus on dilute, well-mixed systems, whose description
              using ordinary differential equations has served as the basis for
              traditional chemical kinetics for the past 150 years. For such
              systems, we review the physical and mathematical rationale for a
              discrete-stochastic approach, and for the approximations that
              need to be made in order to regain the traditional
              continuous-deterministic description. We next take note of some
              of the more promising strategies for dealing stochastically with
              stiff systems, rare events, and sensitivity analysis. Finally, we
              review some recent efforts to adapt and extend the
              discrete-stochastic approach to systems that are not well-mixed.
              In that currently developing area, we focus mainly on the
              strategy of subdividing the system into well-mixed subvolumes,
              and then simulating diffusional transfers of reactant molecules
              between adjacent subvolumes together with chemical reactions
              inside the subvolumes.},
